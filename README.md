# SoPra RESTful Service Template FS21

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to create a Poker game with a lobby system, so that Users can register or login to our system, can chose a lobby where they want to play and, once 5 players are in a specific lobby and are ready, can play Poker. If the User does not have an account yet in our system, he must register to be considered as a valid User. Once he is registered, he can login again with his chosen username and password, if he was offline before. Our Poker game contains a Poker-Instructions page for User that do not know how to play Poker. When playing, a User can click on a button where the poker hands are shown. Therefore, a User can get guidance if he needs some. When playing and on turn, a User can raise, check, fold or call. A game session also contains a chat/log window, where Users can chat or see what events happened in the game. Once a game round is finished, the Server determines the winner(s) and organizes the next game round. A User can always, if he likes, leave a game session and chose in the lobby selection screen a different lobby where he wants to play.

## Technologies

Server (BackEnd):
-	Spring Boot
-	Hibernate
-	Java


## Getting started with Spring Boot

-   Documentation: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/index.html
-   Guides: http://spring.io/guides

## Setup this Template with your IDE of choice

Download your IDE of choice: (e.g., [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and make sure Java 15 is installed on your system (for Windows-users, please make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the correct version of Java).

1. File -> Open... -> SoPra Server Template
2. Accept to import the project as a `gradle project`

To build right click the `build.gradle` file and choose `Run Build`

### VS Code
The following extensions will help you to run it more easily:
-   `pivotal.vscode-spring-boot`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard`
-   `vscjava.vscode-java-pack`
-   `richardwillis.vscode-gradle`

**Note:** You'll need to build the project first with Gradle, just click on the `build` command in the _Gradle Tasks_ extension. Then check the _Spring Boot Dashboard_ extension if it already shows `soprafs21` and hit the play button to start the server. If it doesn't show up, restart VS Code and check again.

## Building with Gradle

You can use the local Gradle Wrapper to build the application.

Plattform-Prefix:

-   MAC OS X: `./gradlew`
-   Linux: `./gradlew`
-   Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

More Information about [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/docs/).

### Build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Run

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Test

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Development Mode

You can start the backend in development mode, this will automatically trigger a new build and reload the application
once the content of a file has been changed and you save the file.

Start two terminal windows and run:

`./gradlew build --continuous`

and in the other one:

`./gradlew bootRun`

If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:

`./gradlew build --continuous -xtest`

## API Endpoint Testing

### Postman

-   We highly recommend to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) in order to test your API Endpoints.

## Debugging

If something is not working and/or you don't know what is going on. We highly recommend that you use a debugger and step
through the process step-by-step.

To configure a debugger for SpringBoot's Tomcat servlet (i.e. the process you start with `./gradlew bootRun` command),
do the following:

1. Open Tab: **Run**/Edit Configurations
2. Add a new Remote Configuration and name it properly
3. Start the Server in Debug mode: `./gradlew bootRun --debug-jvm`
4. Press `Shift + F9` or the use **Run**/Debug"Name of your task"
5. Set breakpoints in the application where you need it
6. Step through the process one step at a time
